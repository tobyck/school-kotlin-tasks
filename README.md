# Computer Science Tasks in Kotlin

If you're thinking "you don't have to Java in high school? Lucky!", unfortunately you'd be wrong (Java, Swing and BlueJ is where it's at apparently). But I'm making the best of a bad situation and using all the tasks we're given as an opportunity to learn something useful instead (unless I'm distracted by one of my five side projects, which is most of the time). 

There are also some UI tasks which I was using to learn [Kotlin Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/), which might go on GitHub as some potentially useful small examples at some point.
